Question:

The manager of a football stadium wants you to
write a program that calculates the total ticket
sales for a game.

There are four types of tickets â€“ Box, Sideline,
Premium, and general Admission. Data is stored
as shown below:

250 5750
100 28000
50 35750
25 18750

The first line indicates the ticket price is
$250 and that 5750 tickets were sold at that
price. Output the number of tickets sold and
the total sale amount. Format your output with
two decimal places.
